/** Calculate and return the heat of combustion of an organic soil based on its organic content.
 *
 * This is a simple calculation that may not be robust for all organic soils.  It assumes that the
 * inorganic content of the soil has no effect on the energy released during combustion and that the
 * pure organic material has a fixed heat of combustion.  The former may be mostly true but the
 * latter is certainly not.  The energy stored in organic material differs by source and level of
 * decomposition.  This function is biased towards rich organic soils, like peats, where we hope
 * these assmumptions will be less problematic.  The organicHOC parameter can also be changed to
 * account for differences in organic quality if information is available.
 * 
 * Additionally the heat of combustion is generally considered for the case of combustion with excess
 * oxygen.  For flaming combustion this may be appropriate but for smoldering combustion can occur by
 * more than one pathway, with different energies.
 * 
 * The smoldering specific formulation includes the component oxidations:
 * ΔH_c = ΔH peat beta char oxidation + ΔH alpha char oxidation + ΔH beta char oxidation
 * However, we only have those from a few papers so we can only make a first order estimate.  We may
 * be able to improve this function over time with more research.
 * 
 * @param[in] inorganicPct The percent organic content of the soil on the dry basis.
 * @param[in] organicHOC The (theoretical) heat of combustion for a purely organic soil (MJ/kg).
 * The peat moss in Frandsen 1987 has a heat of combustion of 20.6 MJ/kg at 3.7% inorganic.  We
 * can estimate that of 100% organic as:
 * 20.6 / (100 - 3.7) * 100 = 21.39148 MJ/kg
 *
 * @returns The soil heat of combustion (MJ/kg, ~net fuel heat content). (ΔH°c)

 * lost tp the atmosphere (though some may recondense as part of the char?).  Second, combustion may
 * not be complete.  We currently have estimates for the smoldering reduction but don't currently

/** Calculate the depth of burn for a generic soil profile.
 * 
 * Ground fire is simulated as smoldering combustion that moves progressively in the downward

 * treated as homogeneous in the vertical direction and vertical spread is not considered.
 *
 * Ground fire initiates when energy input from the aboveground fire into the soil drys and heats
 * the top layer to the temperature of ignition.  Currently the top layer is not treated in a
 * special way.  However, given the importance of ignition we may change this in the future to
 * simulate the surface fire input more explicitly in time and with a full heat transfer
 * representation.
 *
 * The fire extinguishes when the energy to dry and heat the next layer to combustion is less than
 * that transfered from combustion above.  The model uses simplified representations of the process
 * of heat transfer and loss.  The calculation occurs layer by layer without the timing of
 * progression simulated directly, i.e. the model used layer-steps rather than time-steps.
 *
 * @param[in,out] soilCol A GFProfile object representing the soil profile for the simulation.
 * @param[in] fireHeatInput Total longwave heat input into the soil from the surface fire (kJ/m^3).
 * @param[in] heatLossFactor The fraction of heat lost from the soil (0-1) .  This intended to
 *                           represent radiant and convective losses from the soil surface in the

 *                           from Benscoter et al. 2011 = downwardEF. As a heat loss = 0.83.
 * @param[in] surfacePD The maximum heat penetration depth for the soil surface heat transfer
 *                      approximation (cm).
 * @param[in] smolderPD The maximum heat penetration depth for the smoldering heat transfer
 *                      approximation (cm).
 * The following parameters may be temporary:
 * @param[in] surfaceTM The surface heat transfer mode.  0 to distribute the heat evenly, 1 to
 *                      distribute the heat in a linearly decreasing manner with depth.
 * @param[in] smolderTM The smoldering heat transfer mode.  0 to transfer all heat to the next
 *                      layer, 1 to distribute the heat across a depth of smolderPD in a linearly
 *                      decreasing manner with depth.

 * @returns The burn depth (cm).  Additionally the GFProfile passed is updated on return.
